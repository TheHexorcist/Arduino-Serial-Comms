# ArduinoSerialComms
Communication between Arduino Uno and PC using serial communication.

The SR04_SerialComms.ino file uses a ultrasonic sensor to measure distance.

The RxTxForm.java file does all the USB communication from the PC.

Java RTE and Arduino USB drivers are required to make this work.

Some of the other files are for Eclipse IDE.
